								<p>
									My name is Ankit Gahlawat. I am a second year student of the department of Ocean Engineering and Naval Architecture, enrolled in its B.Tech course. I was born and brought up in Sonepat, Haryana.  I am a boarder of Meghnad Saha Hall of Residence. I am contesting for the post of General Secretary Sports and Games, Technology Students’ Gymkhana, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, for the academic session 2014-15.
								</p>
								<p>
								The very basis of my candidature for the post of General Secretary Sports and Games, Technology Student’s Gymkhana, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, stands on my active participation in various extra-curricular activities. During my stay at IIT Kharagpur, I have been actively involved in different spheres namely Football, Athletics, Cricket, Dramatics and Choreography.
								</p>
								<p>
								Sports have always been an integral part of my life, having started playing football at the age of 8. To begin with some of my major achievements, I have played football at the District level and was the captain of football team of “Rishikul Vidyapeeth” School. In my first year I was one of the three 1st year, Inter – IIT probables in football for the 48th Inter – IIT sports meet. I was a member of the gold winning Inter-Hall Football team and also a member of Cricket and Athletics team of Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya Hall of Residence. In my second year I was a playing member of Bronze winning Football team of IIT Kharagpur in the 49th Inter IIT Sports Meet held at IIT, Guwahati. This was certainly an achievement for IIT Kharagpur as we bagged this position after a span of four years which came under my tenure of Secretary, Football Sub-Committee, Technology Students Gymkhana.
								</p>
								<p>
								As the Secretary, Football sub-committee, I initiated the participation of IIT Kharagpur in the Boca Juniors Football Champs. It was the first time ever, we participated in such tournament. I was one of the player from IIT Kharagpur who participated in this tournament and we won bronze medal. I have also won bronze medal in the 5km open IIT road-race and have participated in 800m, 1500m, 5000m race & 6.6 km road-race for Meghnad Saha Hall of Residence in Inter Hall Athletics Competition. I was the Vice-Captain of the Gold winning football team of Meghnad Saha Hall of Residence in Inter-Hall tournament.
								</p>
								<p>
								I am a responsible person, committed and dedicated towards any assignment that I undertake. The experience gained from being involved in various events and at different levels of competition along with holding position of responsibility as the Secretary, football Sub-Committee gives me the confidence to take up the responsibility of General Secretary, Sports and Games, Technology Students’ Gymkhana, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur and work with full devotion and dedication for the upliftment of the sporting culture of IIT Kharagpur.

								<p>
									Here’s how we have gone about the analysis. The proposals are rated on a scale of 10 – 2 points for the need, 4 for the feasibility of implementing the said proposal and 4 for the impact it will have if implemented. Under feasibility and impact, we have also considered the life-cycle of similar proposals by previous G.Secs over the years. Also, we have analyzed the proposal which was discussed by the candidate during the soapbox as we have noticed that those are usually the most important proposals of the candidates and those are most likely to be implemented if he/she wins.<br />
									The candidates are free to reply to any of the critiques and we shall put it up on this post.
								</p>

								<p><strong>Proposal:</strong> Assign points to the March-Past event in the General Championships – Sports and Games.<br />
								<strong>TSA Score: 6.5/10.</strong></p>

								<p><strong>Need of the proposal:</strong> Owing to the dismal performance of IIT Kgp in the March-Past event in the past few Inter-IIT tournaments, this proposal is critical in terms of what we need. This might give us an edge when it comes to Inter-IIT standings.<br />
								<strong>TSA score: 2/2.</strong></p>

								<p><strong>Feasibility:</strong> This proposal should be fairly simple to implement. Given the rules of this event are agreed upon by all the halls, we can expect to see this event in the next GC if the candidate is elected. But if the aim is to improve the Inter-IIT performance in March-Past, a more efficient solution might be to train those people in a more rigorous manner compared to status quo. Given that Inter-IIT players might just need a couple of days’ practice, this move might be a bit too elaborate.<br />
								<strong>TSA Score: 3/4.</strong></p>

								<p><strong>Overall impact:</strong> The tangible benefit to gain out of this is a raise in Inter-IIT March-Past performance. While on the other hand, the expected increase in punctuality and team spirit seem to be a stretch. There is not much analysis on how this is different from all other team sports which already take care of team spirit and the sort. The impact on the average Kgpian’s life in terms of increased sporting culture is very marginal.<br />
								<strong>TSA Score: 1.5/4.</strong></p>

																	<p><b>PROPOSAL 1:</b></p>

									<p>I propose to introduce an exclusive Open IIT tournament for all the sports for the Postgraduate students to increase the Postgraduate participation in Inter IIT Sports Meet.</p>

									<p>Post Graduate participants have a lot of talented players but most of them have limited their play only to Inter Hall events. I propose a plan to take it a step further and increase their participation in Inter IIT Sports Meet which will not only be a boost for the Post Graduate players but for IIT Kharagpur too.</p>

									<p>Inspite the fact that nearly 41% of the students’ community at IIT Kharagpur is composed of the Postgraduates, only 7 players out of the 162 member contingent are Postgraduates, a mere 4.32%.</p>

									<p><b>Workflow:</b></p>

									<ul>
									<li>Separate Open IIT tournaments of all the sports will be held for the Postgraduate students.</li>
									<li>If the participation in any sport is not found to be up to the mark, department wise league matches will be conducted for that particular sport to attract more participation.</li>
									<li>Separate Inter IIT trials of all the sports will be held for them.</li>
									<li>Though separate Open IIT tournaments and Inter IIT trials will be held for Post Graduate participants but they still can take part in the Open IIT tournaments and Inter IIT trials open to all the student community.</li>
									<li>Timely and regular notices with the full information about the upcoming sports events would be posted in the respective Post Graduate Halls of Residence. And also proper publicity through creative posters &amp; from social networks will be done.</li>
									<li>The General Secretaries of Sports of all the Halls of Residence will be roped in to raise awareness for the events. I would also take the aid of respective Inter IIT players to spread word about the events. The Gymkhana General Secretaries and Secretaries of Sports along with Post Graduate Representative will themselves go to every Post Graduate hall to spread awareness about this separate tournament.</li>
									<li>Prizes would be given to the position holders in the Open IIT events through Gymkhana.</li>
									<li>A notification by mail shall be given to every Post Graduate, Research Scholars before any sports event through Vice President.</li>
									<li>A Gymkhana award: “Postgraduate sportsperson of the Year” to the Postgraduate student who is judged to be the best Postgraduate sports player of the academic year.</li>
									</ul>

									<p><b>Conclusion:</b></p>

									<p>It is the duty of the General Secretary, Sport and Games, to ensure a healthy participation of all the student, from all the courses and years, to participant with full enthusiasm in all the sporting events in general and the Inter IIT Sports Meet and Inter IIT Aquatics Meet in particular. Postgraduate students are filled with talent, the need of the hour is to nurture them and keep them involved with the Undergraduate students. I believe that the implementation of this proposal will help me in fulfilling my duties, if elected for the post of General Secretary, Sport and Games.</p>

									<p><b>PROPOSAL 2:</b></p>

									<p>I propose to organize a Sports Summer Camp, which will help the students of IIT Kharagpur to get professional coaching during the summer break.</p>

									<p>The Summer Camp will not only help in involving new players for the practice of Inter IIT but will also serve as a training pitch for the ultimate goal i.e. The Inter IIT General Championship.</p>

									<p>This Open-to-All Camp will be a 15 days long venture for the players and the coaches to interact, play and learn together, precisely to build a team which will be a part of the future Inter IIT Contingent of IIT Kharagpur.</p>

									<p><b>Workflow:</b></p>

									<ul>
									<li>During the camp all the students will reside in their respective halls for which Gymkhana will take prior permission to Hall Management Center.</li>
									<li>A special mess is set up to cater to the various needs of a player so that he/she can cope with the exhaustive and tiresome schedule. In addition to a healthy breakfast, juices are served daily with lunch.</li>
									<li>A caution money of 2000 will be taken by all the campers before the camp so as to bind them to complete the camp out of which 1000 will be returned to them after the completion of the camp and 1000 will be retained by the Gymkhana to reduce its burden of fooding for campers.</li>
									<li>An application form will be distributed through gymkhana with proper notice &amp; publicity through creative posters &amp; also from social networks.</li>
									<li>Daily schedule, duration and method of practice will vary from sport to sport as it will depend on the respective Coach/PTI.</li>
									<li>As a motivation, a token of participation in terms of a Sports Jersey and a certificate will be provided to all the campers.</li>
									<li>There will be slots in the gym and the swimming pool for the teams on alternate day basis.</li>
									</ul>

									<p><b>Benefits:</b></p>

									<ul>
									<li>This camp will help in getting the early attention, specially, of the first year Under Graduate and Post Graduate students.</li>
									<li>First year students can learn a sport of their interest from professional trainers.</li>
									<li>The camp will focus on inculcating endurance and skills within the Inter IIT aspirants.</li>
									</ul>

									<p><b>Conclusion:</b></p>

									<p>The proposal addresses to the needs of student community in general and Inter IIT aspirants and participants in particular and hence will be instrumental in upliftment of sporting culture in the campus.</p>

									<p><b>PROPOSAL 3:</b></p>

									<p>I propose to assign points in the General Championship Sports &amp; Games to the existing March-Past event. This will not only foster unity and discipline in sports, but also help us in improving our performance in the March-Past at the Inter IIT Sports Meet.</p>

									<p>In the past few years, the performance of IIT Kharagpur has not been up to the mark in the event March-Past which in general proves critical in the final standings. Moreover, it is a well-known fact that discipline and co-ordination form the core of any sport. So, this proposal will also help in the overall development of the sporting culture in our campus.</p>

									<p><strong>Workflow:</strong></p>

									<ul>
									<li>The March-Past event will contain 10 points as in Inter-IIT General Championship</li>
									<li>Points scored in March Past will be counted in Sports &amp; Games General Championship tally</li>
									<li>Minimum attendance required from the Boys’ Halls of Residences will be 50 and 30 for the Girls’ Halls of Residences</li>
									<li>At least 90% of the Inter-IIT Sports Meet probables and Inter-IIT Aquatics Meet players from the respective halls should be a part of the March-Past</li>
									<li>NCC officers will be asked to judge the event.</li>
									<li>All the Halls of Residences should carry their own name plate and flag.</li>
									<li>The Uniform for both Boys and Girls shall be:<ul>
									<li>White Shirt</li>
									<li>Black Pants</li>
									<li>Black Shoes</li>
									<li>If any hall of residence taking part in Athletics &amp; will not come for March Past then points will be deducted from the Sports &amp; Games General Championship tally.</li>
									</ul>

									</li>
									</ul>

									<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>

									<ul>
									<li>As the points of the event March-Past will be included in the General Championship, more importance will be given to it</li>
									<li>It will provide proper practice of March-Past to Inter-IIT Contingent, which plays a crucial role in Inter-IIT Sports Meet</li>
									<li>March-Past enhances the qualities of confidence, discipline and team spirit in a sports person.</li>
									<li>Scheduling the event a week prior to the Inter-Hall Athletics Meet will help us in providing a much needed flexible and more accommodating fixture for the Inter-Hall Athletics Meet.</li>
									</ul>

									<p><b>Conclusion:</b></p>

									<p>By including the points of March-Past in the General Championship Sports and Games, we can expect more attention given to this aspect of sports, which will not only prove vital in enhancing discipline and punctuality in the game but will also serve as a training pitch for the ultimate goal i.e. The Inter IIT General Championship.</p>

									<p><b>PROPOSAL 4:</b></p>

									<p>I propose to provide a solution to the problem of Inter IIT practice being affected by rain by using polythene covers in 3 outdoor sports namely basketball, volleyball, and tennis.</p>

									<p>Due to rain the Inter IIT Practice is being hampered in all the outdoor sports and also Inter Hall schedules are affected by it.</p>

									<p><b>Workflow:</b></p>

									<p>I plan to use Polythene covers to cover the following outdoor sports grounds during rain which will enable immediate practice after rain stops, saving the time taken for drying thus increasing the practice in those sports:</p>

									<ul>
									<li>Basketball</li>
									<li>Tennis</li>
									<li>Volleyball</li>
									</ul>

									<p><b>Benefits:</b></p>

									<p>Inter IIT practice can be done smoothly just after rain stops. We will need not to wait for the courts to dry.</p>

									<ul>
									<li>It will be helpful in having an option of delaying an Inter Hall match till raining (If it rains for some time) instead of postponing it for a day which affect the whole schedule.</li>
									<li>It will be used to cover the courts all the time so that rain cannot affect the court.</li>
									<li>It is a one-time investment, solution to the hampering of Inter-IIT practice sessions by rain in some sports at least.</li>
									</ul>

									<p><b>Conclusion:-</b></p>

									<p>With more practice, the performance in these sports can be improved thus it will be helpful improving overall performance of the entire Inter IIT contingent in the Inter IIT Sports Meet.</p>

								<p>During my stay at IIT Kharagpur I have been actively involved in various fields of extracurricular activities included in sports and games or social and cultural categories. All these have added to my experience and confidence which has provided me the belief to take up a position of responsibility like this.</p>

<p>Sports have always been an integral part of my life. Here at campus I started with winning the gold medal in the fresher’s badminton tournament. Since my first year, I have been a playing member of the inter IIT badminton team. I have represented IIT Kharagpur in the 48<sup>th</sup> inter IIT sports meet held at IIT Roorkee. In my second year, I won a gold medal in the Open IIT Badminton tournament. I was a part of bronze winning badminton team of IIT Kharagpur at the 49<sup>th</sup> Inter IIT Sports Meet held at IIT Guwahati. This medal came after a long span of five years.</p>

<p>I started playing badminton at the age of eight. I have received a silver medal in the Chhattisgarh U-13 open state badminton doubles tournament. I have represented my school at zonal level football tournament for two consecutive years and our team successfully achieved silver and gold medals subsequently. I presented a project on ‘Waste Management in Urban Areas’ in the 96<sup>th</sup> Indian Science Congress at North Eastern Hill University, Shillong.</p>

<p>During my first year, I have represented Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya hall of residence in Inter Hall Badminton and Table Tennis tournaments. I also stood third in the fresher’s event of western vocals.</p>

<p>I am currently the Secretary Sub-Committee volleyball and basketball of Homi Jehangir Bhabha hall of residence. I have represented my hall in ‘sports and games’ general championships’ in badminton football and squash as well as in ‘social and cultural’ general championships’ in hindi dramatics and eastern instrumentals.</p>

<p>Apart from this diversified involvement I have managed to maintain a decent CGPA of 8.32.</p>

<p>I believe that the experience gained from being involved in different events and at different levels of competition along with holding several positions of responsibility will be of utmost importance for executing my duties if elected for the post of general secretary sports and games and work for the upliftment of sporting culture at IIT Kharagpur.</p>

</p>

<p><strong>Proposal :</strong> Development of an online portal for registration and slot allocation in Gym, Tennis, Pool and Swimming.<br />
<strong>TSA Score: 7/10.</strong></p>

<p>Need of the proposal:Very high. One of the most frustrating experiences in campus is to stand in queues. Also, any reduction in paperwork in Bongland is most welcome.<br />
TSA Score: 2/2.</p>

<p>Feasibility: As demonstrated by Ashwin, this proposal is definitely implementable. Significant groundwork has already been done by him. The only question mark can be over online payment capability among first years (which significantly reduces the need to stand in queues), but with increasing internet penetration, this won’t be a problem in the foreseeable future.<br />
TSA Score: 3/4.</p>

<p>Overall impact: Although this does reduce the time one has to spend in queues, the overall impact on the sports and games culture in KGP is not very high. It can be argued that people who are passionate about a particular sport in KGP will not be offset by a mere queue.<br />
TSA Score: 2/4.</p>

								<p>My name is Rajeev Lochan Chakraborty.</p>

<p>I am a second year student of the department of mining engineering enrolled in its B-Tech course.<br />
I am from Ranchi.<br />
I am a boarder of Lala Lajpat Rai Hall of Residence.</p>

<p>I am contesting for the post of General Secretary- Sports and Games, Technology Students Gymkhana, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur for the academic session 2014-2015.</p>

<p><strong>SOP</strong><br />
General Secretary plays a vital role in ensuring the smooth functioning of the various activities under the Technology Students Gymkhana ranging from Inter IIT Sports meet-practice and conditioning, to Inter-hall Sports General Championship. The culmination of experiences that i have gained in my life make me a suitable contender for this post.</p>

<p>As the captain of my school team for 3 consecutive years I have led my team to win two Gold medal, one Silver medal and a bronze medal at various zonal and state level table tennis tournaments. Being the best under-17 table tennis player, not only in Bhubaneswar but in the entire khurda district , I was selected as the captain for the under 17 khurda district team. Under my Pilotage the khurda district team successfully bagged the silver medal in State Level School’s Table tennis for two consecutive times. Due to my exemplary and excellent performance at the state level championships I was selected to represent the Orissa state at the national level under-17 table tennis championship.Continuing the same performance at IIT I have won the silver medal in Open IIT Table Tennis Tournament 2013. I was the part of this year’s bronze winning Inter IIT Table Tennis Team which represented IIT Kharagpur at the 49th inter iit sports meet held at IIT Guwahati. This was achieved after a gap of three years and this achievement resulted in propelling the GC standing of IIT Kharagpur from 6th to 3rd, a feat that hasn’t happened in the last 5 years.</p>

<p>Besides sports I was actively involved with The Entrepreneurship Cell,IIT Kharagpur for 2 years. In my first year in E-cell, i worked in the capacity of a GES Intern and was responsible for publicising Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Bhubaneswar. As a result the participation in GES from this area increased for 71 to 124 and 5 media articles about GES were published in this region. In my second year i worked in the capacity of an associate member and I was responsible for conducting EAD(Entrepreneurship Awareness Drive) in two cities- Bangalore and Ranchi. In both the events I was responsible for fixing the guest lectures and the workshops and I successfully arranged workshops by IBM in Bangalore EAD and Array Consultancy in Ranchi EAD. I also played a very significant role in the publicity of these events which resulted in participation of around 300 in each EAD. As Associate Manager I was responsible for conducting empresario that is the annual business plan competition which receives around 1500 entries.</p>

<p>I have actively contributed in my hall’s Silver winning illumination and bronze winning rangoli. I was the part of bronze winning inter-hall table tennis team of Lala Lajpat Rai Hall of Residence. I was also responsible for conducting ‘futsal, which is a 5 a side football tournament conducted by Lala Lajpat Rai Hall of residence.</p>

<p>If elected as the General Secretary Sports and Games,Technology Students’ Gymkhana I shall discharge my duties with utmost dedication and to the best of my abilities.</p>

									<p>Here’s how we have gone about the analysis. The proposals are rated on a scale of 10 – 2 points for the need, 4 for the feasibility of implementing the said proposal and 4 for the impact it will have if implemented. Under feasibility and impact, we have also considered the life-cycle of similar proposals by previous G.Secs over the years. Also, we have analyzed the proposal which was discussed by the candidate during the soapbox as we have noticed that those are usually the most important proposals of the candidates and those are most likely to be implemented if he/she wins.<br />
The candidates are free to reply to any of the critiques and we shall put it up on this post.</p>

<p><strong >Proposal:</strong> To structure the conditioning for the inter-IIT players in the form of circuit training, this will be common for every sport and will provide general fitness.</p>

<p><strong>Total TSA Score: 5.5/10.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Need of the proposal:</strong> Average, at best. While it is beyond doubt that fitness improves performance in sports, it is yet to be proven that it is lack of fitness which is the reason for Kharagpur’s below par performance in the Inter-IIT sports meet. Also, circuit training is not recommended for some sports like lawn tennis, as cited Mallika Saharia, a national level player.<br />
TSA Score: 1/2.</p>

<p><strong>Feasibility:</strong> The time slot mentioned in the proposal is 6 am to 7 am. Since there are several inter-IIT probables in every sport (as many as 40 in football), we are looking at some 300 blurry eyed sportspersons. This proposal also requires huge amount of organisational skill and coordination between PTIs. Perhaps it is best if every sport has its own conditioning routine.<br />
TSA Score: 1.5/4.</p>

<p><strong>Overall impact:</strong> Although not very feasible and there being significant doubt over its need, this proposal does have the potential to have a huge impact on KGP’s sporting culture. The mere sight of a hundred-odd sportsmen sweating it out in the wee hours can invigorate an otherwise lethargic campus, and will definitely increase bonding among sportsmen.<br />
TSA Score: 3/4.</p>

									<p><strong>Proposal 1:-</strong></p>

<p>I propose to structure the conditioning for the inter-iit players in the form of Circuit Training which will be common for every sport and will provide general fitness.</p>

<p><strong>Description :</strong></p>

<p>There is a lack of a proper conditioning structure for the inter-iit players of various sports. Every sport does it in its own different way and in some sports it happens without instructions from the PTI incharge. Hence to solve this problem I propose to introduce a compulsory structured conditioning for every sport.</p>

<p>Time : Morning : 6:00 AM – 7:00 AM</p>

<p>Assemble all the inter-iit players in Jnan Ghosh Stadium and conditioning will be done together for all the sports.</p>

<p>Studies at Baylor University and The Cooper Institute suggest the practice of ‘circuit training’ as the best form of training that can given to a sportsman. Circuit training is a form of body conditioning or resistance training using high-intensity aerobics. It targets strength building and muscular endurance. A “circuit” is one completion of all prescribed exercises in the program. When one circuit is complete, one begins the first exercise again for the next circuit. Traditionally, the time between exercises in circuit training is short, often with rapid movement.</p>

<p>A circuit should work each section of the body individually. The conditioning will be carried out with the instructions from PTIs and they will guide us through this procedure. Apart from circuit training, sport- specific training will also be given to the players by the Physical Training Instructors(PTI’s).</p>

<p>Typical activities include:</p>

<p>Upper-body</p>

<ul>
<li>Squat ups</li>
<li>Bench dips</li>
<li>Back extension.</li>
</ul>

<p>Core &amp; trunk</p>

<ul>
<li>Sit ups (lower abdominals)</li>
<li> Stomach crunch (upper abdominals)</li>
<li> Back extension chest raise</li>
</ul>

<p>Lower-body</p>

<ul>
<li> Squat jumps</li>
<li> Compass jumps</li>
<li> Astride jumps</li>
<li> Step ups</li>
<li> Shuttle runs</li>
<li> Hopping shuttles</li>
</ul>

<p>Total-body</p>

<ul>
<li> Burpees Treadmills</li>
<li> Squat thrusts</li>
<li> Skipping</li>
<li> Jogging</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li> Increase the bonding between inter iit players.And we can have an information aboutothers teams and their performance.</li>
<li>This type of training helps in reducing injury and helps tone the player’s muscles to an optimum level. .</li>
<li> Circuit training is the most time efficient way to enhance cardiovascular fitness and muscle endurance</li>
</ul>

<p><strong >Proposal:</strong> To reconstruct the sports section of the gymkhana website by adding interactive and informative features.<br />
<strong >Total TSA Score : 6/10.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Need of the proposal:</strong> There is definitely a need for sports in KGP to develop in the virtual world. This portal will serve as a database for famous inter-IIT stories, and as an information dissemination means. However, it is difficult to understand why IIT KGP SPORTS fb page cannot be used for the same.<br />
TSA Score: 1.5/2.</p>

<p><strong>Feasibility:</strong> Proposals on the lines of online portal have gained a lot of traction in the past few years. However, their maintenance has left a lot to be desired. Also, lack of any significant groundwork on the candidate’s part further erodes our confidence.<br />
TSA Score: 2/4.</p>

<p><strong>Overall impact:</strong> This proposal has its heart in the right place. It wants to highlight achievements of inter-IIT players, and develop a forum for interaction between budding sportsmen. If it is maintained throughout the year and gains traction amongst students, it will have a net positive impact on sporting culture in KGP. But the extent of that impact is reduced due to competition with the IIT KGP SPORTS Facebook page.<br />
TSA Score: 2.5/4.</p>

</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>Part 3:</strong> Online feedback portal for Sports and Games.<br>
<strong>TSA Score: 7/10.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>Need of the proposal</strong>: &nbsp;This will provide the necessary boost for players in terms of recognition and motivation as opposed to currently being known only in the sporting circles. The move will also bridge the gap between the Inter-IIT and students of Kgp by amplifying the reach and efficacy of both TSA and Aawaz. The online portal for sports equipments will certainly benefit students, especially freshers who would want to buy sports equipment for NSO/Inter-IIT practice. Any system that addresses grievances is a good thing. This might reduce the entry barrier among students to complain given the anonymity clause, especially with players constantly complaining about courts and other infrastructure.<br>
</span><strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">TSA Score: 1.5/2.</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Feasibility:</strong> While the idea of a portal seems lucrative and simple, the complexity of maintaining one for a prolonged period of time is immense. A lot of manpower is required to record videos of podium matches for all sports which easily runs into a little shy of 50 matches, to edit them and put them up online. Even though outsourcing work to societies might seem like a viable option, unless the candidate is extremely passionate about this, implementing it might prove to be an uphill task. Reports and coverage, however, can be worked out. Brownie points for already whipping up a website at <a href="http://10.102.71.12/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://10.102.71.12']);">http://10.102.71.12/</a>.<br>
<strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">TSA Score : 2.5/4.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>Overall impact:</strong> The teams are certainly going to feel a lot more exclusive and motivated with the focus being on the efforts they put to bring glory home. Sports themed newsletters will also help in furthering the sporting culture in Kgp. But, given there already exists a IITKGP Sports Facebook page, the increase in information dissemination might prove to be marginal.<br>
</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Currently, most sporting needs are currently acquired through halls for their practice. So, it might make more sense to even include halls under the ambit of this move. But, Flipkart or other similar e- commerce websites might prove to be the biggest competitors.<br>
</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">There have been innumerable portals proposed in the past and none of them currently work the way they were intended to. Despite being a well intended proposal, this might just join the ranks of the other portals that fizzled out after a few days of inception.<br>
</span><strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">TSA Score : 3/4.</span></strong></p>

<p><b>Proposal 1:</b></p>

<p><i>Part 1:</i> <i>Creation of an information dissemination system for sports and games</i></p>

<p>I propose to introduce an online portal which will focus on making radical changes in important aspects. The online portal will highlight the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>The semi-final and final matches of all sports in the General Championship will be video recorded and uploaded on the portal. Same will be done for prominent inter-IIT practice matches.</li>
<li>After the conduction of the final matches of all inter-hall sports, there will be an in-depth report on the portal in collaboration with The Scholars’ Avenue and Aawaz. This report will seek to analyze the entire tournament, highlight key players and turning points.</li>
<li>There will be extensive coverage of the inter-IIT sports meet as well via this portal. Similar to IIT Bombay Broadcasting Channel, a couple of sports journalists will accompany the inter-IIT contingent and seek to provide immediate results, statistics and key clashes. At the end of each day, a “Captains’ Speak” video will be made where all captains will sit together and analyze the overall performance and chances of the contingent.</li>
<li>Two newsletters, specifically for sports and games, one before and one after the Inter-IIT sports meet will be published in collaboration with The Scholars’ Avenue and Aawaz.</li>
<li>This portal would also a database for accessing and assessing past records and performances.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Benefits:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Will increase the awareness and motivation for freshers which will in turn increase the participation and promotion of sports and games in institute.</li>
<li>Will give much needed recognition to sportspersons in the institute which will increase their confidence, motivation and hence performance. For example, there are some famous inspirational stories about inter IIT players; this portal well serve as a common platform for all those stories about dedication and determination.</li>
<li>The web portal will serve the purpose of providing day to day updates and happenings in sports and games in IIT Kharagpur for both current students and alumni.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Ground Work:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Portal has already been created and can be accessed at 10.102.71.12.</li>
<li>Following features have already been incorporated :</li>
<li>Video and Report of the final match of inter hall badminton</li>
<li>Inter-IIT records of Athletics and Aquatics.</li>
<li>Inter IIT results</li>
<li>Inter hall points tally</li>
<li>Gymkhana Awards of 2012-2013</li>
<li>Have contacted <i>Technology Film Making and photography Society (TFPS)</i>. They have a keen interest in this proposal and agreed to collaborate with Technology Students’ Gymkhana to provide video footage for important sporting events in the campus.</li>
<li>The <i>Scholars’ Avenue</i> and the <i>Aawaz </i>have given positive feedback regarding this proposal and are eager to contribute to sports coverage in the campus.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Part 2: Online sports equipment purchase portal for students</i></p>

<p>IIT Kharagpur has a location disadvantage in terms of buying equipment on a large scale. Through this portal, any student can enlist the sports equipment required by them and deposit advance money. After fifteen days the whole inventory will be purchased from a recognized and expert sports dealer on whole sale price. After that the equipment will be distributed to the students with the bill of their item. This will ensure students are able to obtain sports equipment at a low price.</p>

<p><b>Benefits:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>It will provide a common platform to the sports community of IIT Kharagpur to buy sports equipment at a much lower price.</li>
<li>Good quality products will be supplied, and the onus will be on Gymkhana to ensure quality of the product being supplied.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Ground work:</b></p>

<p>We contacted:</p>

<p>1) Bajaj sports, New Delhi</p>

<p>2) Sahara sports ,Kolkata</p>

<p>3) Planet sports ,Kolkata</p>

<p>4) Olympia sports house, Kolkata</p>

<p>for purchasing items at whole sale prices and we were confirmed the availability of items of brands like Nivia, Cosco, Adidas, Nike, Stag, BDM, SG, GM, SS, ATE, Yonex, Usi universal, Kobo, Vijanti, Head, Vinex and VI with lowest possible prices and superior quality.</p>

<p>This system is well implemented in IIT Bombay. I have spoken to Mr. Harmin Shah, General Secretary, Sports Affairs, IIT Bombay for the academic session 2013-2014. Also the current General secretaries sports and games Mr. Abhishek Malhotra and Mr . Shrrinesh Balasubramanian have given positive feedback regarding this proposal.</p>

<p><i>Part 3: Online feedback Portal Regarding Sports and games</i></p>

<p>This feedback portal will only be visible while using the proxy server of IIT Kharagpur. Anyone can login with their institute email ids and can register a problem on the portal anonymously. The General Secretaries of Sports and Games and the secretary of the concerned sport or game have to reply back on the portal within 7 days clearly stating what steps have been taken to solve that particular problem.</p>

<p><b>Benefits:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Any student of IIT Kharagpur who is facing any kind of problem regarding sports and games can register the problem and office-bearers will respond in a time bound manner.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have already created by scroll back.io account which is an online feedback portal with the help of alums Mr. Gaurav Srivastava (2005 batch) and Mr. Arvind Ravi (2006 batch) and have also answered several questions already on the forum</p>

<p><b>Proposal 2:</b></p>

<p><i>“To increase the functional timings of different courts in Gymkhana”</i></p>

<p>Since there are limited number of courts for around 10,000 students in IIT Kharagpur, hence during the evening hours there is a lot of which not only deteriorates the courts but also creates problems for players. Hence I propose to increase the timings of courts till 11 pm. During the opening hours it will be ensured that proper rules and regulations are being followed and that players are maintaining the decorum of the Gymkhana. I have spoken to both the current General Secretaries regarding this issue and have found them in complete agreement with this proposal.</p>

<p><b>Benefits:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Increased timings will ensure that courts are available to Inter-IIT players for a longer duration.</li>
<li>Problem of heavy rush during the evening time will be solved to a great extent.</li>
<li>Will motivate those players who didn’t come to practice because of rush to practice at an hour of their choosing.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Proposal 3:</b></p>

<p><i>“Availability of a dietician (Sports Nutritionist) and a permanent orthopaedic doctor”</i></p>

<p><b>Nutritionist</b></p>

<p>The Sports Dietician provides individual and group/team nutrition education to enhance the performance of competitive and recreational athletes, on-site and during travel. Ultimately the aim of the sports dietician is to maximize performance. The dietician will come in the month of August and on the basis of the physique of the inter-IIT players will recommend an appropriate diet. This will be followed by analysis on a week-to-week basis. This will surely enhance the performance of our players in Inter-IIT.</p>

<p><b>Benefits:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Counsels athletes on optimal nutrition for exercise training (match nutrition to training phases and goals), competition, recovery from exercise, weight management, hydration, immunity, disordered eating, travel, and supplementation.</li>
<li>Proper guidance will be there about the different supplements available.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Orthopaedic doctor</b></p>

<p>In the competitive world of sports, players are frequently injured. In most cases, the players that are injured have a significant impact on the performance of the team. These injuries, if not taken care of in a proper manner, lead to more aggravated problems. Hence, an orthopaedic doctor is required to ensure that athletes undergo correct and effective treatment so as to ensure speedy recovery. It is also required that this doctor is permanent as only recurring and persistent treatment is the solution to these kinds of injuries and a permanent doctor will ensure this.</p>

<p><b>Benefits:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Effective and early recovery from minor injuries sustained during practice.</li>
<li>A professional healing plan for players who have sustained long term injuries.</li>
<li>Increased confidence in our players while practicing as they are aware of a support mechanism in place.</li>
</ul>

								<p>My name is Abhay Srivastava. I am a second year undergraduate student in the department of Ocean Engineering and Naval Architecture, enrolled in its dual degree course. I am from Kanpur. I am a boarder of Nehru Hall of Residence. I am contesting for the post of General Secretary Technology, Technology Students’ Gymkhana, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, for the academic session 2014-2015.</p>

<p>During my two years of stay at IIT Kharagpur, I have participated in a plethora of extracurricular activities. In my first year, I was an integral part of the inter-hall ad design team of Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya Hall of Residence.</p>

<p>In my second year, I was a sub head in the core organising team of Samudramanthan 2014, the annual technical meet of the department of Ocean Engineering and Naval Architecture. As a sub head, I was involved in various facets of the technical meet, namely sponsorship, events and publicity, apart from being a web team member.</p>

<p>On the sponsorship front, I was responsible for securing 22% of the total sponsorship amount. As a part of the events team, I was involved in planning and execution of frigate blast which was a new event introduced by me. On the publicity front, I publicized the technical meet in various colleges of Kolkata. As a result my initiatives, there was a considerable increase in participation from these regions.</p>

<p>In addition, I was a part of the gold winning inter hall ad design team of Nehru hall of residence. I was also involved in various inter-hall events spanning across all general Championships. I was a part of the gold winning inter hall choreography and silver winning inter hall rangoli teams of Nehru hall of residence. I was also a part of the open IIT dramatics team, inter hall dramatics team and inter hall cricket team of Nehru hall of residence.</p>

<p>I secured 5th rank in U P board examinations, for which, I was felicitated by the former president of India Dr A P J Abdul Kalam. Apart from being an integral part of Samudramanthan and participating in various events of the general Championships, I have been able to maintain a CGPA of 8.36.</p>

<p>Thus, the experience and outlook that I have gained, during my two years of stay at IIT Kharagpur, aptly makes it clear that if elected as General Secretary Technology, I would work for the benefit of the student community of IIT Kharagpur, with utmost efficiency, dedication and sincerity.</p>

									<p><b><em>Proposal</em>: To introduce a Puzzle Club in IIT Kharagpur.</b></p>

<p><em>Synopsis</em>: The Puzzle Club would consist of 10 freshers and 8 2nd years who will be responsible for conducting its various activities. The club would invite company representatives and alumni to conduct interactive seminars on puzzle solving. Weekly problem sets (and solutions eventually) would be released and an annual general aptitude competition would be organised.</p>

<p><em>Critical Analysis</em>: Proposal’s interesting. It’s true that puzzles and general aptitude play a pretty big part during placements and competitive exams. However, simply giving people puzzles to solve on a weekly basis makes this more of a hobby club rather than one actually aimed at distinctly bettering puzzle solving skills. It is critical that the weekly puzzles are original and unique and not simply replicated from the internet, or else students would rather prefer solving from the leisure of their rooms using their laptops. Seminars and sessions dedicated to lateral thinking and logical reasoning would be great measures aimed at betterment. These have been mentioned in the proposal as being conducted by alumni, but alumni email replies have not been included. What have been included are email replies from company executives, who seem quite supportive and enthusiastic.</p>

<p><b><em>Proposal</em>: To facilitate seed funding for the winners of Product design and Hardware Modelling by contacting the concerned companies</b></p>

<p><em>Synopsis</em>: The winning entries in the events Hardware Modelling and Product Design will be given the opportunity to further develop their ideas by receiving funding from prospective companies looking to market that product / hardware.</p>

<p><em>Critical Analysis</em>: This proposal has its head in the clouds but suffers from lack of implementation details. First of all, we believe the goal of IIT KGP’s SRIC (Sponsored Research and Industrial Consultancy) is similar, as in, it provides students funding for novel ideas and technologies developed and promotes industrial-academia collaborations. In fact, this proposal should consider collaborations with SRIC, RMSoEE, STEP, etc. This proposal definitely will provide students with a great platform to see their brainwaves being implemented, but exactly how this will be made official and details about the channelisation of company’s funds have not been provided. Having said that, this proposal may open doors to prospective summer internships.</p>

<p><b><em>Proposal</em>: To introduce a biannual newsletter that would contain various matters related to technology</b></p>

<p><em>Synopsis</em>: Content development to be done by the Technology Literary Society and will feature information on the Technology GC, relevant gymkhana societies and interviews from professors and alumni. 7,000 copies of this 6-page newsletter to be printed and distributed. (And by the way, biannual means twice a year, not once in 2 years).</p>

<p><em>Critical Analysis</em>: Implementation is a pretty severe issue here. Interviews from ‘distinguished alumni’ and ‘respected professors’ do not come easily. Also, without the absence of a dedicated technical team (which TLS isn’t) in charge of the newsletter, there exists the possibility of this degrading to simply a publicity brochure for the Technology GC events. The author also wonders how exactly this would significantly enhance the average person’s technical awareness, given the general aversion to reading among kids of today.</p>


							</div>
							<div class="tsatext" id="P-6" style="display: none;">
									<p><strong>PROPOSAL 1</strong></p>

<p>I propose the introduction of puzzle club at IIT KHARAGPUR. Brain teasers and aptitude oriented problems have always fascinated those with a knack for puzzle solving. Researches on brain functionality have shown that tackling and mastering puzzles tremendously aid in the sharpening of cognitive abilities. Strategically designed puzzles can easily be extrapolated to several real life situations, proving to be a valuable simulation. Such aptitude based skills can be rather difficult to hone due to the miscellaneous nature of puzzles ranging over a wide variety of disciplines. This proposal would facilitate the students of IIT Kharagpur in achieving the desired goal.</p>

<p>Aim-</p>

<p>Through this proposal I aim at increasing the involvement of students in tackling puzzles based on mathematics, to the scale of various Olympiads, puzzles based on algorithm design. Which would greatly help students in solving aptitude questions, which they usually encounter in various exams (GRE, CAT, and GMAT) and also during their placement.</p>

<p>Structure of Puzzle club-</p>

<p>Puzzle club would consist a group of motivated students who would be responsible for conducting the various activities of this club. There would be 10 members and 8 sub heads in the club. A sub head would be a second year student and a member would be a first year student at IIT Kharagpur.</p>

<p>Sub head and member selections would be held in the first week of august. For selection, a general aptitude test would be held to shortlist students. There would be a personal interview round for shortlisted students which would lead to final formation of the team.</p>

<p>Activities-</p>

<p>Puzzle club would be involved in following activities-</p>

<ul>
<li> Puzzle club would invite representatives of various esteemed companies to hold a interactive seminar at IIT Kharagpur.</li>
<li> Puzzle club would contact distinguished alumni of IIT Kharagpur to conduct a seminar at IIT Kharagpur to showcase the importance of puzzles, puzzle solving techniques, problems on quantitative aptitude.</li>
<li> A problem set would be released by the puzzle club on a weekly basis. The solution to that problem set would be released with the next problem set. The problem set would be mailed to those students who would attend the seminars and workshops held by puzzle club. An introductory mail would be sent to each and every student of IIT Kharagpur in which there would be an option to subscribe to the puzzle club for weekly problem set. Any student who is not be able to attend the seminar, he would also be able to get those problem sets by subscribing to the puzzle club.</li>
<li> Puzzle club would conduct a competition based on general aptitude, which would be held on a yearly basis.</li>
</ul>

<p>Benefits-</p>

<ol ><li>This will help our institute to gain an even higher reputation as students will be able to perform well at various national and international levels, as healthy performance depends highly on the analytical skills gained.</li>
<li>The successful completion of the proposal will ensure that students are well prepared much in advance to face companies in their selection procedure. This in turn, will increase both the number of internships and placements from the college.</li>
<li>Development of analytical skills will enhance logical thinking among students, which would aid them in taking guided decisions in testing situations of various aspects of life.</li>

<p><strong>PROPOSAL-2</strong></p>

<p>I propose to facilitate seed funding for the winners of Product design and Hardware Modelling by contacting the concerned companies. The road from the inception of an idea to finalizing a product that embodies an idea is very fulfilling for any participating team. This proposal will aid in turning a refined idea into finished product ready for launch into a real life market, which would provide a better exposure to practical problems and their solutions and this will also increase the research environment in the institute.</p>

<p>Through this proposal I aim at increasing the participation of the student community in these events which will ultimately lead to recognition at a much wider platform and increase the industry-academia collaboration.</p>

<p>DETAILS:-</p>

<p>To facilitate students with seed funding, General Secretary Technology, Technology Student’s Gymkhana would take the consent of the General Secretaries Technology of various winning halls of residence, who are willing to further develop their product with some funding and he will then enlist the names of companies which are related with the winning entries. General Secretary Technology, Technology Student’s Gymkhana would contact those companies, keeping the interest of students in mind and he would arrange seed funding for the winning entries which would increase the industry-academia collaboration. After having successfully launched a product which was initially just an idea will provide practical experience of real-life product development.</p>

<p>BENEFITS:-</p>

<ol ><li>This will help the students to collaborate easily with the industry as the models would then be considered as projects completed under the industry and hence will also enhance the research environment in the institute.</li>
<li>Generally the students do not get a real idea of how their model is going to actually work or perform. Through seed funding, the ideas will come into action and give students more practical exposure.</li>
<li>This will help students to commercialize research and also lead to industry diversification. When their ideas get valued and implemented, the students will come to know of the incorporation, product development and what it leads to successfully launch a product.</li>
</ol><p>Appendix:</p>

<ol ><li>We have contacted the DEAN Student affairs, Professor Nisith Ranjan Mandal regarding this proposal, and he has shown a positive response.</li>
<li>We have contacted DEAN Sponsored research and industrial planning, Professor Sunando DasGupta regarding this proposal, and he has also shown a positive response.</li>
<li>I have contacted to Mr. Anoop Singh, a representative of General Electric with a previous year’s gold winning product design entry NIRMAL SEVAK, which was essentially a dishwasher and they have shown a willingness to provide seed funding for the particular product. In the first batch of funding, General Electric is willing to pay Rs 30000.</li>
</ol><p><strong>Proposal 3</strong></p>

<p>I propose to introduce a biannual newsletter that would contain various matters related to technology. Technology General Championship has become very competitive over the years. The general championships are aimed to foster the technical knowhow of the students. However it is observed that the general championship is not too widespread amongst all the students. More over Newsletters have been one of the most powerful tools of communication and to keep the audience informed and engaged. Keeping this in mind, through this I intend to promote the interest of students in the field of technology, increase opportunities for them and guide them towards their passion. All this would lead to increased awareness amongst students towards technology general championship and its benefits.</p>

<p>AIM-</p>

<p>Through this proposal, I aim at increasing the awareness of students in the technology general championship and keeping them ahead at the technical front by introducing them with the major happenings inside and outside the campus. Which would ultimately lead to increased participation in the general championship.</p>

<p>DETAILS-</p>

<p>The details about the newspaper are as follows-</p>

<ul>
<li> The newsletter would be published biannually.</li>
<li> The newsletter would consist 6 pages.</li>
<li> The dimension of each page would be 8.3” X 11.7”.</li>
<li> Total 7000 copies would be published for each newspaper.</li>
<li> Printing of the newsletter would be black and white.</li>
</ul>

<p>Task of content development would be done by the TLS (Technology Literary Society).</p>

<p>BENEFITS-</p>

<ul>
<li> Advancements in the diverse sphere of technology are frequent and game changing. Milestones are surpassed by the hour as we move towards newer developments. Such circumstances make it extremely essential for us to constantly remain in the loop of awareness. The newsletter will help with this particular goal.</li>
<li> Participation in technology based events in the General Championship has always been enthusiastic. If technology in all its glory were to be made even more appealing, the events would see more informed participation from previously unaware students.</li>
<li> The newsletter will cover details of other noteworthy competitions and events enabling students to also indulge in events other than what our college has to offer.</li>
</ul>

<p>NEWSLETTER CONTENT:-</p>

<ul>
<li> About Technology general championship</li>
<li> Regarding work of gymkhana societies, Technology Robotix society and Quiz club.</li>
<li> About various competitions CIMA (Chartered Institute of Management Accountants)<p>and Hult.</p>

</li>
<li> Interview from respected professors</li>
<li> Interview from distinguished Alumni</li>
</ul>

<p>APPENDIX-</p>

<ul>
<li> We have contacted the Dean, student affairs, Professor Nisith Ranjan Mandal regarding this proposal and he has shown a positive response.</li>
<li> I have contacted to present Governor, Technology Literary Society, Mr. Ketan Mundhada. He has given me a confirmation that TLS is willing to write the articles for the newsletter.</li>

<p>My candidature for General Secretary Technology, Technology students Gymkhana is based up on my active involvement in Various Extracurricular activities during my two years of stay at IIT Kharagpur. </p>

<p>Currently I am the General Secretary Technology for Lal bahadur shastry hall of residence. I initiated the preparations for General Championship technology in Lal Bahadur Shastry hall of residence. During my tenure I have been successful in increasing the participation of Lal Bahadur Shastry hall in General Championship Technology by many folds. In the debut performance itself we have been successful in showing impact on General championship Technology by securing respectable positions like fifth in Product Design. <br />
Apart from being General Secretary Technology, I was also actively involved in ad design and product design. In my second year I was a Core Organizing team member of Great Step an Annual fest of Department of Mining engineering IIT Kharagpur. <br />
As an organizing team member in Great Step’13 I have contributed to three major facets of the fest namely sponsorship, Publicity and Event Management. On the sponsorship front I have been successful in fetching major corporate sponsorship from Uranium Corporation of India Limited. I was responsible for publicity in Khenjor in Odisha and Rajamundry in Andhra Pradesh. During Great Step I also conducted two on spot events namely Mineindate and Mineac. <br />
Apart from this I was also a member of Student Welfare group which is a student’s body under the Dean of Students affairs. Being a member of Student Welfare group I along with help of two other members conducted a free Group Discussion and Personal Interview workshop to enhance the soft skills of final year and pre final year students. Being part of Student Welfare group I was also actively involved in Panel Discussion, Student Mentorship programme and Public Speaking forum. <br />
A general secretary Technology, Technology Students Gymkhana should be a good leader, good team player, and hard worker. I confidently believe that the experience gained during these two years and the dedication that I have shown towards my position of responsibilities makes me a suitable candidate for this post. <br />
If I am elected as General Secretary Technology, Technology Students Gymkhana, I would do justice to my role and would work for the welfare of the institute and student body to the best of my abilities. </p>

									<p><b><em>Proposal</em>: To introduce ‘Student Competitions Club’ under the Gymkhana.</b></p>

<p><em>Synopsis</em>: This club categorises the various competitions into 4 categories – Coding, Robotics &amp; Artificial Intelligence, Case Study, and B-Plan &amp; Marketing, and would assign 8-10 students advisors and a professor in charge for each category. The club will conduct open house sessions and launch an online portal where details of related competitions as well as study material, sample problem statements, etc. would be updated.</p>

<p><em>Critical Analysis</em>: The first thing which strikes you is – aren’t there already student bodies for almost all these activities? The answer is yes – the CS department Code Club, KRAIG and the B-Club were initiated by students to excel in these activities. These student groups, like every other, have online forums to discuss activities and feature seniors who have been-there-done-that guiding juniors. While the scope of the proposal is huge and very beneficial to a typical student, the author is forced to raise the question – ‘why a new club?’ Although the candidate should be commended for contacting several people, both students and professors, from very relevant backgrounds in connection with this proposal, it would have been interesting to know their responses.</p>

<p><b><em>Proposal</em>: To introduce a Finance Club on campus</b></p>

<p><em>Synopsis</em>: The club aims to enhance the knowledge of Finance among students and help them plan for the same as an alternate career. It would consist of 5‐8 tutors from VGSoM and 10‐12 tutors from other Departments/Schools/Centers, who would conduct open house knowledge sharing sessions. An online portal would be launched where study material and assignments would be uploaded. The management team of this club would be responsible for conducting guest lectures, workshops and competitions like Equity Research Report, Finance Quiz, Basic Finance Modelling and Practical Case Discussions.</p>

<p><em>Critical Analysis</em>: This proposal is novel and bold. A finance club in a technological institution may be frowned upon by some purists as a means to dilute the focus on core engineering. But there is no mistaking that a career in finance is becoming a rave option for KGP graduates. The proposal is also fairly well documented (from what the candidate gave us), however, no email replies have been included, which raises the big question whether any of the high-profile people whose names have been mentioned actually agreed to this and to what extent. There’s also the question of a sudden overdose of clubs springing up all over the campus if all these proposals are implemented.</p>

<p><b><em>Proposal</em>: To conduct Awareness sessions in all halls of residence from where there is considerably lesser participation in the Technology General Championship</b></p>

<p><em>Synopsis</em>: These sessions are targeted towards PG and 1st year UG students and will be conducted by one of the Technology General Secretaries and the Post Graduate Representative. Details regarding the Technology General Championship would be explained and handouts elaborating the events would be distributed. Interested students can sign up for particular events and they would be guided by the respective student advisors.</p>

<p><em>Critical Analysis</em>: Proposal-wise, it seems to be an alternate version of the orientation programme that undergraduate second years experience at the beginning of the year. That way, there is no novelty in this at all. However, we were struck by the outreach and kind of publicity for technical events this candidate has managed to garner in LBS hall of residence (of which he is currently the G.Sec Technology) through an attractively designed <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9bnqfh42fw1i5qm/Newsletter%2C%2016th%20August.pdf" >newsletter</a>. This speaks of the volume of effort put in, but apart from that, there is little to suggest what concrete good can come out of simple awareness sessions in various halls.</p>

								<p>My name is Raja Ambrish. I am a second year undergraduate student of the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences enrolled in its five year Integrated Msc. Course of Economics. I am from Dhanbad. I am contesting for the post of General Secretary Technology, Technology Student’s Gymkhana , Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur for the academic session 2014-2015.</p>

<p>I strongly believe that my desire and confidence to contest for the post of General secretary, Technology is well contented by the multifarious experiences I have gained in my school life as well as my stay at IIT Kharagpur.</p>

<p>Currently, I hold the post of Undersecretary, Technology committee member of Lala Lajpat Rai Hall of residence. I have efficiently managed the practice sessions of the 9 Technology General Championship events along with other Technology committee members. I was instrumental in preparation and maintenance of Technology General Championship budget of my hall along with General Secretary Technology of my hall of residence and other Technology Committee members. I was an integral part of Inter hall Ad design, Product Design and Case Study teams wherein I was also a part of Product Design presentation team. I was also a part of silver winning Illumination and bronze winning Rangoli teams of IIT Kharagpur. During my tenure I secured an SGPA of 8.52 and improved my CGPA to 7.89.</p>

<p>As a part of four member marketing associate team of Focus, a coaching institute affiliated to Resonance, I was responsible for 16 newspaper articles, 3 interactive media sessions and publicizing the institute in 10 different schools all across Dhanbad which led to an increase in batch strength by 40% and 50% in subsequent years.</p>

<p>In my first year, I was an associate member of Business club of IIT Kharagpur. As a part of the publicity team, I was instrumental in publicizing its flagship event “Indian Case challenge 2013” in the cities of Kolkata &amp; Dhanbad.</p>

<p>In my first year, I participated in Shrishti, a startup ideation event by Rajendra Mishra School of Engineering Entrepenuership, where my idea was highly appreciated. Working enthusiastically on the idea, I created a business plan and was a finalist in business plan competition of Kshitij 2013. I have been working on the same business plan for the past one year and will be launching the startup as Co-founder.</p>

<p>I have also taught as a tutor for the startup “collegepedia.in” which provides free online lectures to the students preparing for the engineering entrance exams.</p>

<p>At the end of my first year, I interned at mintzone.in as a marketing intern.</p>

<p>Not limiting myself to the technology genre, I was a part of Interhall dramatics and the open IIT events of Hindi elocution and Hindi dramatics.</p>

<p>I have qualified the first round of Astronomy Olympiad and Kishore vyagyanik Protsahan Yojna. I participated in case study events by Entrepreneurship cell – IIT Guwahati and was finalist in Techniche IIT Guwahati, Indian Case Challenge 2014 and Audit in Kshitij 2014.</p>

<p>If elected as General Secretary Technology, Technology students’ gymkhana, I will discharge my duties with utmost dedication and sincerity.</p>

									<p><b><em>Proposal:</em> To introduce an e-brochure for increasing awareness about Technology General Championship among Post Graduate, Research scholar &amp; First Year students.</b></p>

<p><em>Synopsis</em>: The brochure will be mailed through Vice President’s mailer and will also be shared on the social media pages. It will contain event descriptions, basic rules and a collection of resources from where students can acquire the basic skills to participate. It will also contain information about Inter IIT Tech meet.</p>

<p><em>Critical Analysis</em>: The candidate already has a hard copy of the brochure ready. While this is to be commended, the shallow nature of this proposal leaves a lot to be desired. Firstly, such a thing can be done within a day and there is no follow-up mechanism to ensure that people actually read the brochure and gain something from it, let alone be encouraged to participate in technical events. Secondly, the rules of an event are communicated to all participants well in advance, and as such we fail to see the need for such details. To summarise, this seems like something the vice-president would suddenly do on a particular afternoon, and not a proposal.</p>

<p><b><em>Proposal:</em> To introduce a ‘Data Analytics’ event in the Technology General Championship</b></p>

<p><em>Synopsis</em>: The problem statement for this event will be provided by a company, whose representatives will judge the event. The event would be conducted in the month of January or October.</p>

<p><em>Critical Analysis</em>: Does everyone know what data analytics is? Well, that seems to be tackled in the 3rd proposal. Coming to the specifics of the event, the author is forced to scratch his head and take shots in the dark, because absolutely no specifics have been provided except for the tentative dates. At least the team size and event duration should have been mentioned.</p>

<p><b><em>Proposal:</em> To conduct workshops on ‘Data Analytics &amp; Case Study’ for increasing the employability of students of IIT Kharagpur</b></p>

<p><em>Synopsis</em>: The workshop on Data Analytics will be conducted over a span of two days and run for 8 hours each day, with topics like Machine Learning, Data Mining, and tools of Data Analytics being covered. The Case Study workshop will be conducted in association with IIT KGP’s B-Club and will focus on sample case studies and related tools/techniques. The workshops would be held in the Autumn semester, around August-September.</p>

<p><em>Critical Analysis</em>: This is a decent proposal, as the fields of data analytics and case studies are extremely relevant when it comes to placements (helped by the fact that IIT KGP’s core engineering placement scenario seems to be heading south). But we feel the details are somewhat insufficient. Pertinent implementation aspects such as which companies would be associated with the workshop, who it will be open to and most importantly, how a host of complicated topics and software can be efficiently taught in a couple of days (even while assuming 8 hours a day), are missing.</p>

								<p>A General Secretary, Technology should have a right balance of technical knowledge, intellect and managerial aptitude.</p>

<p>During my stay at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, I have taken an active part in a number of events of the institute. In my 2<sup>nd</sup> year I have worked as a member of the Food Monitoring Committee. During my tenure as Food Monitoring Committee member, I have conducted regular inspections of eateries, Hall Mess and Hall Canteens. I proposed a fine structure for eateries in the campus pertaining to various violations. We also introduced a food quality testing mechanism to ensure a more rigorous check on food quality. In addition to that we conducted a continuous month-long survey of the mess of Lal Bahadur Shashtri Hall of Residence and submitted the compiled report to the Dean of Student Affairs. Apart from that I represented Homi Jehangir Bhabha Hall of residence in Technology General Championship in the events of Ad Design, Product Design, Tech Quiz and Biz Quiz. In Social &amp; Cultural General Championship I participated in Hindi Dramatics. I also took part in Open IIT English Elocution.</p>

<p>In Kshitij, the annual techno-management fest of IIT Kharagpur, I secured 2<sup>nd</sup> place in Audit, a financial case study on the economic performance of the states of India, while competing with teams on a national level. In Nashify, the on-spot Game theory event, I strategized my way to the 3<sup>rd</sup> place.</p>

<p>I have earned laurels at not only IIT Kharagpur but also at International level.</p>

<p>I have won the gold medal for India at the World Space Olympiad, 2011 organised by UNESCO and Roscosmos in Paris. I gave my presentation at UNSECO headquarters in front of a panel of dignitaries including Valentina Terishkova, Irina Bokova and Georgy Grechko.</p>

<p>I have represented India at the International Earth Science Olympiad, 2009 in Taiwan and won a bronze medal for my country. For my feat, I received accolades from Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India.</p>

<p>I was awarded A-Star India Youth Scholarship by Ministry of Education, Singapore Government.</p>

<p>As the captain of a multinational team, I won the Best Cooperation Team award at the International Team Field Investigation, Taipei.</p>

<p>I am recipient of Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana (KVPY) fellowship and National Talent Search Examination (NTSE) scholarship.</p>

									<p><b><em>Proposal</em>: To initiate a winter orientation cum training camp (OCTC) along with regular weekend workshops for the preparation of the Inter IIT Tech Meet.</b></p>

<p><em>Synopsis</em>: The OCTC will improve all-round technical skills of students and inculcate a feeling of team spirit, all with an aim towards performing better in the annual inter-IIT Tech meet. The camp will comprise secretaries and general secretaries of technology, along with professors to train students for each event. Workshops are scheduled in Oct – Nov and the camp in Dec.</p>

<p><em>Critical Analysis</em>: Given the skyrocketing number of students in KGP, one needs to first conduct a filtration process to decide who will form the inter-IIT contingent. This, according to the candidate, will be based on performance in open-IIT tech events, which don’t exist as of now. Even if they are introduced (refer to next proposal), they will take place at the beginning of the autumn semester, whereas the events to be held in the next inter-IIT tech meet will be finalised in October. Professors undoubtedly will be able to provide guidance to the students, but their academic and administrative commitments have not been taken into account. A positive reply from a professor was required to lend some credence to this proposal.</p>

<p><b><em>Proposal</em>: To initiate Open IIT Technology Events under the banner of Technology Students’ Gymkhana</b></p>

<p><em>Synopsis</em>: There will be at least 5 events – Tech Quiz, Biz Quiz, Math Olympiad, Case Study and Ad Design. Other events based on Inter IIT Tech Meet events would also be introduced. These events aim improve the participation of freshers, 2nd years and PG students in Tech events as well as the preparation of students for Inter IIT Tech Meet.</p>

<p><em>Critical Analysis</em>: The concept of trying to increase fresher and postgraduate extra-curricular participation through the introduction of more open-IIT events has been stated by lots of previous candidates. As for training people for the inter-IIT tech meet, 2 problems exist. As already discussed, the inter-IIT events will not be known in August-September, when we assume the open-IITs will be held. Secondly, the list of events sounds like a trial run for the interhalls rather than the open-IITs. We would also like to point out that collaboration with spAts, the Kalpana Chawla Space Centre and revival of the erstwhile Astro Club would help in the inter-IIT event Messier Marathon, if it is held again.</p>

<p><b><em>Proposal</em>: To start a Data Analytics Society under the banner of Technology Students’ Gymkhana</b></p>

<p><em>Synopsis</em>: The society is inspired by the demand for data analytics in various big name corporations, and will aim to develop knowledge on softwares like MATLAB and statistical analysis tools among students. The society will conduct fortnightly workshops and execute projects.</p>

<p><em>Critical Analysis</em>: Data analytics is a raging field today, especially when it comes to placements, no doubt about that. Knowledge of MATLAB, which is much, much more than just a data analytics software, is also required for many engineering branches. If implemented efficiently, this society can become an extremely useful one. The scope of the projects is rather vague though.</p>

									<p><b>Proposal 1:</b></p>

<p>To initiate a winter orientation cum training camp (OCTC) along with regular weekend workshops for the preparation of the InterIIT TechMeet.</p>

<p><b>Aim of the Orientation cum Training camp (OCTC):</b></p>

<ul>
<li>The winter orientation cum training camp will improve the performance of IIT Kharagpur in the annually held Inter-IIT TechMeet.</li>
<li>It will focus on whetting the all-round technical skills of students in all aspects.</li>
<li> It will acclimatize the students to the various problems faced during the events .</li>
<li>To provide regular practice to the team members, and giving them a chance to get regular guidance and feedback from the faculty.</li>
<li>To promote communications and team spirit with the team members.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Need of such an Orientation cum training camp (OCTC):</b></p>

<ul>
<li>It was observed that in the second InterIIT TechMeet held at IIT Bombay, IIT Kharagpur managed to bag only one medal in Software Developent and did not score anything else in either Social Impact or Messier Marathon.</li>
<li>Lack of resource material, proper guidance and motivation are the causes for this dismal performace.</li>
<li>It will ensure enhanced and quality participation in all the competitions.</li>
<li>There is a need to inculcate a feeling of team spirit among the different participants.</li>
<li>It will give the students proper exposure to the recent developments in the fields pertaining to the events.</li>

								<p>In my two years of stay at the Indian Institute of Technology,Kharagpur I have got myself into the continuous process of growing as a holistic whole through active participation in numerous curricular ,extra-curricular and co-curricular activities that have helped me excel in varied spheres namely- academic, technical, and socio-cultural at the institute. In my first year, I was a part of the gold winning Mathematics Olympiad team of Lal Bahadur Shastri hall of residence. My first year also saw me accomplish academic feats wherein I was appreciated by then dean UGS for securing a perfect SGPA of 10.0. I also went on to achieve a department change from Dept .of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering to Dept. Of Electronics and Electrical Communication engineering at the end of my first year.</p>

<p>In my second year I joined the team of the Autonomous Ground Vehicle, a research group under dean SRIC, IIT Kharagpur.As a software member in the team , I am giving my best efforts towards achieving the ultimate aim of Team AGV ie building India’s first fully operational self driving car. I am also a member of the hardware exhibtion team, product design team, ad design team and Mathematics Olympiad team of Radha Krishnan hall of residence and successfully won silver in Ad design and bronze in product design at the General Championship technology 2013-2014. Along with being a member of inter hall teams of these events, I am the Secretary, Technology of Radha Krishnan hall of residence. During my tenure as the Secretary technology I have ensured smooth and effective management of various teams that represent Radhakrishnan Hall of Residence in various events at the General Championsip,Technology.</p>

<p>I have also a part of the Gold winning Illumination team and silver winning Inter Hall Hindi dramatics team of Radha Krishnan Hall of residence. Apart from these co- curricular achievements, I havealso outshined academically with a cgpa of 9.63. Involving myself enthusiastically and extensively in numerous activities at the institute has inculcated in me the confidence and imbibed in me the qualities that are required to efficiently discharge the duties as the general secretary technology, Technology Students’ Gymkhana. If I am elected as the Gsec tech,TSG,I will carry out my duties and manage my responsibilities with vigour, perseverance and hard work and determination.</p>

									<p><b><em>Proposal</em>: To introduce a data analytics event in the Technology GC and form a Data Analytics club under the Gymkhana eventually; to promote the culture of data analytics in the Institute</b></p>

<p><em>Synopsis</em>: The event would take place in collaboration with analytics firms over a span of 10 days at the conclusion of which teams have to submit a report and give a presentation. The proposed data analytics club will be mentored by a professor and managed by student Governors. The club will promote participation in competitions (like those held by<a href="http://www.kaggle.com/" >www.kaggle.com</a>) and conduct workshops.</p>

<p><em>Critical Analysis</em>: The vision of the proposal – ‘Data analytics is one of the most fast-trending and sought after fields in both the corporate and the technological sector’ – is fairly accurate. Details on the GC event and objectives and selection procedure of the club have been nicely elaborated and we believe the potential for such a club to help students is big. However, the functioning of the club requires further scrutiny and, of course, more details. The projected benefits of the club have been overestimated, particularly regarding promotion of entrepreneurship. A start-up in this field demands more than just exposure to that domain. Lastly, it appears as though the introduction of the event and club are coupled and it would be more beneficial if the latter is introduced first to ensure that the proposed benefits are achieved.</p>

<p><b><em>Proposal</em>: To increase the output of the Technology General Championship by archiving the submissions of various events</b></p>

<p><em>Synopsis</em>: An online portal will be created, accessible to everyone inside and outside the campus, to store all submissions, presentations and questionnaires (Maths olympiad) of all the Technology GC events.</p>

<p><em>Critical Analysis</em>: This proposal is simple to implement and also very practical. We feel this is an excellent and very achievable idea that will preserve and showcase the brainwaves and hard work of campus students. A potentially important aspect that has been overlooked is a student’s possible desire to patent his/her creation, which would mean it should be hidden from the public eye. Also, perhaps a filtration process which ensures only the better and refreshingly original ideas are preserved will make for a better exhibition of KGP’s talent.</p>

<p><b><em>Proposal</em>: Open House Exhibition</b></p>

<p><em>Synopsis</em>: The exhibition provides a platform where professors and students can present their current running projects/proposed projects, along with proper media coverage and a website which showcases all projects and their details.</p>

<p><em>Critical Analysis</em>: Promises of media coverage for some of KGP’s flagship events have been made before, but not kept. This proposal seems extremely idealistic as getting all professors and students under one roof to showcase all the research work being done by them is impractical to be carried out as single event. The time frame hasn’t been discussed and the decision to launch a single website to showcase all research work is a extremely generic. One already has departmental websites dedicated to this task.</p>

								<p>My name is Bodhisattya Bhattacharya. </p>

<p>I am a second year student of the department of Chemical engineering, enrolled in its B.Tech course. I am from Kolkata. I am a boarder of Radhakrishnan Hall of Residence. </p>

<p>During my two-year stay at IIT Kharagpur, I have been a part of various academic and extra- academic activities. <br />
I have been actively involved in Technology Dramatics Society Druheen since my first year. As a part of it, I have acted in two plays, and subsequently directed and participated in another play. <br />
I was an integral member of the design team of the gold-winning Illumination of Radhakrishnan hall of residence. I was also actively involved in executing the hall’s silver-winning Rangoli and was a member of its guest reception team. <br />
As a participant from Radhakrishnan Hall of Residence in the Social and Cultural General Championship, I was awarded Individual gold in Bengali elocution; in addition, the hall won overall gold, continuing its streak of coming first for four consecutive years. I played the lead role in the silver winning Hindi Dramatics. I was also a part of the bronze winning debate team. <br />
<br />
</p>

<p>Along with these extracurricular activities, I was able to change my department to Chemical engineering, in which I currently hold the first rank. At the end of my first year, I successfully completed an internship at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata, completing a project on polymers which is currently pending publication in the journal Macromolecules. <br />
I have completed two further projects at IIT Kharagpur in my first and second years respectively. I have received the Jagadish Bose national science talent search scholarship, the KVPY scholarship for the academic session 2011-2012 and the Indian Academy of Science fellowship for 2014.</p>

<p>I co-founded a group called “Awaaz”, where we microfinance low-income group people for starting up new ventures. At school level, I won the inter-school one-act play competition organized by British Council and Central School of Speech and Drama, London.<br />
I was also awarded the best scriptwriter award for two consecutive years. In the academic sphere, I cracked the National Standard examination in Chemistry and was selected for national level science Olympiads. </p>

<p>I believe that these accomplishments, the balance between academics and extra-academics reinforces my time-management skills, perseverance and dedication, qualities I believe are required to successfully discharge the duties of general secretary, technology students gymkhana. </p>

									<p><b>1.) Development of a portal which shall record and maintain the problems faced during the GC events along with their solutions across the years.</b></p>

<p>Brief summary:</p>

<p>An online portal, editable only by the GSecs, containing comprehensive data about problems faced during GC events in past years and steps taken to tackle the problems. A search feature is provided to access the required data efficiently. The portal is publicly viewable. Edit and login histories are maintained to ensure accountability.</p>

<p>Pros:<br />
A uniformity can be maintained among the solutions implemented to resolve conflicts during events. Participants are likely to be more informed about potential problems that can creep up in the events.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Enormous burden on GSecs to update the database after each event as they would be the only ones with access, especially considering that Soc-Cult GC has the highest number of events. This can be resolved by giving compartmentalized login access to the Secretaries.</p>

<p>Candidate’s defence to cons:</p>

<p>I believe that the General Secretaries shall have ample opportunity and time to update the information, considering that Spring Fest shall be separate from the purview of the General Secretaries (though the amendment is under discussion and not yet passed). I don’t think this task will take up too much time, and is worth the effort considering its benefits.</p>

<p>In addition, the details of login access have not been completely confirmed, and a final resolution shall be taken only after a meeting with the various concerned parties. It is possible that the Vice President too will have editing privileges. Hence, I would not like to say that it is “only” editable by the General Secretaries.</p>

<p><b>2.) A competitive social and cultural weekend exclusively for post graduates and research scholars.</b></p>

<p>Brief summary:</p>

<p>A three day Social and Cultural meet, held across a weekend. There will be a wide variety of events and workshops conducted by professionals. Awareness of this program to be increased by widespread publicity in PG and RS halls of residence.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>An event organised exclusively for PG and RS students will undoubtedly bolster their ties to a campus where, more often than not, they feel unfairly excluded from day to day activities.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Right now, a considerable number of PG students turn up only for a few select GC events. Other GC events see negligible participation from this segment of the campus society. If this behaviour is reflected during the proposed cultural meet, it could mean a waste of resources. A survey conducted to ascertain the viability of this proposal states that 63% of the surveyed students would participate in such an event. However, the veracity of this too is doubtful, since the likelihood of a surveyee placing a tick on an online form is much higher than him actually turning up for the event.</p>

<p>Candidate’s defence to cons:</p>

<p>The post-graduate students are free to participate in the General Championship, but a three-day Meet is comprehensive. Hence, I am sure it shall get a good response. With respect to publicity, information can be made available through Hall publicity and discussion in the post-graduate orientation seminar of the Institute, with due permission from the Administration. I would like to point out that IIT Bombay and IIT Guwahati have also conducted such Meets, which have had a positive effect on the post-graduate participation in the General Championship.</p>

<p><b>3.) An initiative to begin a PAN-IIT Meet in the Social and Cultural division</b></p>

<p>Brief summary:<br />
An Inter IIT Social and Cultural meet along the lines of Inter IIT Sports Meet and Inter IIT Tech Meet.</p>

<p>Pros:<br />
New avenues for a healthy spirit of competition among sister IITs are always welcome. Expanding the variety of events for prospective participants to showcase their talents on a higher platform is commendable.</p>

<p>Cons:<br />
While IIT Kharagpur could certainly organize the inaugural meet, the continued existence of this program would require similar commitments from other IITs, without which the program would fizzle out after sometime.</p>

<p>Candidate’s defence to cons:</p>

<p>I have mailed various IITs regarding this. IIT Kanpur and IIT Guwahati have expressed their enthusiasm for such a Meet, while other IITs have expressed interest in further discussion. In addition, the various societies of the IITs have responded very positively to the initiative, expressing their keen interest for such a platform.</p>

<p>I understand that this is a large-scale proposal which may not be completed in my tenure. Hence, I have focused on three areas – Debating, Dance and Music. For example, an Inter-IIT Parliamentary Debate can be conducted, with the confirmed assistance of the respective Debating Societies. Similarly for Music Societies, considering our very own, MonkeyCap, which can display its talent on a large forum. We should at least try to implement such a platform and give talented individuals the chance to compete on such a forum.</p>


							</div>
							<div class="tsatext" id="P-11" style="display: none;">
									<p><strong>Proposal 1:</strong></p>

<p>My first proposal is aimed at streamlining the organisation of the Social and Cultural General Championship, by developing a portal which shall record and maintain the problems faced during the events along with their solutions across the years. </p>

<p>Requirement: </p>

<p>The Social and Cultural General Championship comprises of a highly competitive series of events conducted by the Gymkhana every year. The successful execution of the General Championship depends on the efficient management of the conducted events, which is hampered in the current scenario by the lack of official information regarding previous organisational problems. Due to a lack of recorded precedent, differing courses of action are proposed to similar problems happening across multiple years, affecting the uniform standard of the events. </p>

<p>Solution: </p>

<p>To tackle this issue, I propose to make an official Gymkhana online portal which can serve as a source of officially recorded information regarding previous organisational problems in the General Championship and the corresponding action taken, ensuring the smooth conduction of the events in future on the lines of past precedent. </p>

<p>Operation: </p>

<p>I would like to walk you through the details of my proposal.</p>

<p>The online portal, in addition to containing various details regarding the General Championship events like the date, points distribution, standings etc., will also include the details of organisational problems encountered in previous years, and the courses of action taken in response to such situations. The problems shall be classified into several categories, with tags being put for the respective problems. </p>

<p>The portal contains a search feature which utilises data mining for efficient results. There are three areas of search – year, event, and tag, which allows the user to obtain the details of necessary problems faced in a particular event across the past few years. This feature ensures that if a recorded problem occurs in a future event, the judge(s) can be presented with officially documented information of similar problems in the past, the judge’s ruling on the issue, the video recordings of the event (if available) and the final courses of action taken (such as a sub-committee meeting and its outcome). Decisions can then be taken accordingly.</p>

<p>The portal’s data can be accessed in an unrestricted manner by any member of the student community, with a simple browsing interface for increased utility. However, the authority to update the database with new details as per the progress of the General Championship is placed only in the hands of the General Secretaries Social and Cultural. A login system is put in place, by which the General Secretaries can add details of the event to the database. In addition, there will be rigorous vigilance of the edit and login history of the database, so as to ensure accountability.</p>

<p>Benefits:</p>

<p>The major benefits of this proposal are:</p>

<p>The inclusion of precedence, which greatly simplifies the decision-making process.</p>

<p>The convenient availability of essential information in the form of an officially maintained ledger will reduce organisational problems by incorporating the concept of precedence. This makes the decision-making process easier, because there are officially noted instances of similar problems in the past, thereby allowing the concerned parties to take action in an informed and efficient capacity.</p>

<p>Improved awareness among the participants and organisers regarding the rules and potential problems, thereby allowing for improved quality of events with fewer problems.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Participants shall be more informed of the rules and regulations of the events, and potential problems, by learning from past incidents. Thus, they can focus on improving the scope and quality of the events. </p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>Hence, I sincerely believe that this proposal shall tackle several problems faced, and improve the social and cultural facet of the institute.</p>

<p><strong>Proposal 2:</strong></p>

<p>My second proposal aims at improving the overall Social and Cultural facet of the Institute, through increased involvement of all sections of the student community in social and cultural activities, by organising a competitive cultural weekend exclusively for post-graduate students and research scholars. </p>

<p>Requirement: </p>

<p>The extent of participation of post-graduate students and research scholars in the Social and Cultural General Championship is significantly lower that that of undergraduate students. this is due to their intense academic schedule, which makes it difficult for them to participate in competitive events year-round. As the result of a survey conducted among the post-graduate students and research scholars showed, there is widespread support for a separate platform to allow a greater amount of participation in Social and Cultural activities. Hence, I propose a three-day Social and Cultural fest for participation by post-graduate students. </p>

<p>Operation: </p>

<p>In collaboration with the Secretaries, and the active support of the Vice President, a three-day Social and Cultural Meet, held across a weekend, shall be conducted in the second week of October. The Meet will include competitive events and professional workshops conducted across a wide range of activities. I have received positive replies from professionals for conducting workshops and judging events. A tentative schedule and set of rules and regulations of the Meet are available in Appendix – 2A and 2B respectively, with confirmation for organising the workshops available in Appendix – 2C. </p>

<p>The publicity and awareness of this Meet shall be undertaken by promoting it in those Halls of Residence which include post-graduate students, using presentations and face-to-face interactions. In addition, the details of the Meet shall also be included in the post-graduate students’ orientation day, hosted by the Institute Administration and Vice President, Technology Students’ Gymkhana. </p>

<p>Budget:</p>

<p>I have contacted various establishments in and around IIT Kharagpur, who have been willing to sponsor this Meet.</p>

<p>Benefits:</p>

<p>As an integral part of the student community, I sincerely believe that it is imperative for the Gymkhana to increase and sustain participation of post-graduate students in its initiatives and events. An exclusive Meet shall go a long way in integrating the post-graduate students into the Gymkhana more thoroughly, thus binding the entire student community into a single fabric under one umbrella. Such a fest will also vastly improve the standards of Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur as an institution of excellence in all spheres, both academic and extra-academic, by inculcating a spirit of healthy competition, and by providing platforms for individuals across all courses to hone their skills in a wide variety of activities.</p>

<p><strong>Proposal 3:</strong></p>

<p>My third proposal intends to initiate a new area of collaboration and competition among the fellow IITs, by undertaking the initiative to begin a pan-IIT Meet in the Social and Cultural division.</p>

<p>Requirement:</p>

<p>The Indian Institutes of Technology constantly endeavour to explore and enhance areas of common interest and collaboration across all spheres of activities, be it academic or extra-academic. The students of the Indian Institutes of Technology are an essential aspect of this aim, fostering an atmosphere of excellence and healthy competition in the fields of sports and technology with the help of the Institute Administrations.</p>

<p>I propose to open a new channel of collaboration in the field of Social and Cultural activities, so as to further integrate the IIT community. In addition, such a pan-IIT initiative shall open up new and extremely competitive avenues for students to hone and display their skills, thereby providing the requisite exposure and experience to further the Institute’s aim of well-balanced development and international renown as a world-class institution. I believe that the students of IIT Kharagpur, who have excelled in various competitive events across the nation, deserve such a platform to gain further recognition. I am also confident that the success of the Inter-IIT Sports Meet, and the growing success of the Inter-IIT Technology Meet, shall also resonate in an Inter-IIT Social and Cultural Meet, which shall continue to grow and develop in the years to come.</p>

<p>Operation:</p>

<p>As outlined in Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur’s Vision 2020 statement, a parameter for improved student performance is “an all round focus with components from each area such as extracurricular activities, research and academics.” To fully realize this potential, it is necessary to execute a large-scale endeavour that encompasses the aspirations of the campus community for the future. In addition, with increasing ties between the various IITs in the fields of sports and technology, and a vibrant and developing academic future, it is a natural step forward to realize the Vision 2020 statement of IIT Kharagpur – hence, an Inter-IIT Social and Cultural Meet.</p>

<p>The Inter-IIT Social and Cultural Meet shall be held in the second week of January, with IIT Kharagpur hosting the inaugural edition of the Meet. To successfully execute such a project for both long-term and short-term benefits, I propose to begin the Meet with events spread across three wide areas – Debating, Dance and Music. As time progresses, the scope of the Meet can increase, with the initiative being taken up by future General Secretaries of IIT Kharagpur, as well as the concerned authorities of other IITs.</p>

<p>To organise the Inter-IIT Social and Cultural Meet, the respective societies of IIT Kharagpur have extended their hands in support of the initiative, and have expressed their willingness to assist the Gymkhana in areas such as hosting, representation and networking. In addition, the respective office bearers and societies of other IITs have also responded positively to this initiative. Details of their responses can be seen in Appendix 3A.</p>

<p>Funding:</p>

<p>The performance of IIT Kharagpur in a pan-IIT event is a source of pride for the institute, setting benchmarks and new standards in an effort to continuously improve and reach new heights. Recognizing the importance of such events, and the benefits of pan-IIT events as seen from sports and technology, I am confident that Institute Administrations shall allocate funding for the Inter-IIT Social and Cultural Meet and give it their full support, much as they do for the Inter-IIT Sports Meet and the Inter-IIT Technology Meet.</p>

<p>Benefits:</p>

<p>An Inter-IIT Social and Cultural Meet has significant and far-reaching benefits, affecting the Institute, the student community and the Gymkhana. With a host of new opportunities for the students to develop their skills and gain valuable exposure and recognition, such a Meet can make great strides towards an illustrious and all-round development of the participating Institutes. This can propel them to new heights of excellence and achievement, and usher in a new era of unity and competitiveness.</p>

							<p>My name is Kartik Pal. I am second year student in the department of Geology and Geophysics, enrolled in its five year integrated MSc. Course of Exploration Geophysics. I am from Noida. I am a boarder of Nehru Hall of Residence. </p>

<p>During my two years of stay at IIT Kharagpur, I have participated in a plethora of extracurricular activities. In my first year, I was an Associate Publicity Member of Spring Fest 2013. I was responsible for publicizing the fest in the colleges of Delhi and NCR, which led to an increase in participation from these regions by 300%.</p>

<p>I am currently the Secretary, Entertainment of Nehru Hall of Residence. As part of my duties, I efficiently managed the 3 events of the entertainment cup, held till now. I participated in open IIT Hindi elocution and won individual gold. I was part of the content creation team, for inter hall debate. I was also a part of the gold winning inter hall ad design team, the inter hall Hindi dramatics team, the gold winning choreography team and am currently the part of the quiz team of Nehru hall of Residence. Apart from managing and participating in the events of the General Championship, I have been able to maintain a department rank 1 in the department of Geology and Geophysics. I have also secured a summer internship at the National Geophysical Research Institute, Hyderabad.</p>

<p>During my school time, I was part of the student editor panel of The Times of India NIE edition, and along with a group of 10 students was responsible for bringing out a day’s edition of the newspaper. I also participated in All India Heritage India Quiz, organised by the Central Board of Secondary Education, and our team came second and third, out of 1221 schools in the Allahabad zone, in 2011 and 2009 respectively.</p>

<p>My involvement in social activities includes being a part of Campaign Rebirth- an organisation aimed at saving the girl child. I am currently holding the post of the media coordinator of the organisation, and am also the part of the content creation team in addition to being the in charge of the online publicity team.</p>

<p>Thus the overall experience and outlook developed during my school life as well as in the past two years of my stay at IIT Kharagpur, aptly makes it clear that if elected as General Secretary Social &amp; Cultural, I will work for the welfare of the student community of I.I.T Kharagpur with efficiency, dedication and sincerity.</p>

								<p><b>1) Proposal: Social awareness drives for students on campus as well as villages around the campus on various pressing issues.</b></p>

<p>Brief Summary:</p>

<p>The awareness drive will be conducted on the social issues of child labour, eve teasing, alcoholism, and drug and substance abuse. Each drive will be of two days, and will be held on a weekend. It will include seminars and interactive sessions.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>This will help to bring about a more rounded personality amongst students who have spent a good amount of time before coming to IIT with their books. Spreading this initiative to the villages will be in tune with the motto of the institute. The timing too, is good.</p>

<p>Cons:<br />
The enthusiasm of the response. Surely, people will not be motivated to wake up early on weekends just to listen to the noise of rallies. The people who must be reached through this article, will probably be far away.</p>

<p>Candidate’s defence to cons :</p>

<p>I am sure that they (the students of IIT Kharagpur) will be supportive of this proposal.</p>

<p><b>2) Proposal: A literary fest in IIT Kharagpur, in association with Technology Literary Society, named “The Hemmingway”</b></p>

<p>Brief Summary:</p>

<p>The fest will have seven events : Wordsworth, wordsmith, Today’s Socrates, Poetria, Faceoff, Entrevue, Inquizitive.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>It will help create literary awareness on campus. It would also give an opportunity to students of IIT Kharagpur, as well as outstation participants, to explore literature. It would also give students access to alternative career options.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>With the already strained budget of the Gymkhana, this proposal seems highly unimplementable. It would require huge logistical planning, which one or two people cannot handle. Whether TLS is open to having an extra burden put on their heads is another question.</p>

<p>Candidate’s defence to cons :</p>

<p>I discussed this proposal with a lot of people who have the experience of organizing a fest. They were supportive of it, and said that it is possible to execute. I believe it’s high time KGP too has a literary fest of its own, as do the sister IITs. Technology Literary Society is very excited about this, and is willing to work with me. I have the consent of its governors.</p>

<p><b>3) Proposal : Introduce photography and film making based events in Open IIT.</b></p>

<p>Brief Summary:</p>

<p>The photography event will be theme based, with the theme being given five days before the event. The film making event will be theme based as well, with the theme being given fifteen days before the submission deadline.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>This will cater to the photography and film making enthusiasts of the campus, as there is no event of this kind in the GC or in the Open IIT.<br />
These Open IIT events could be a prelude to including them in the GC.</p>

<p>Cons:<br />
The event will not be need-blind. The obvious advantages given to people with access to higher quality cameras would tend to make this an elitist event, since not everyone can have access to the five digit costs of the cameras and the lenses.</p>

<p>Candidate’s defence to cons :</p>

<p>I believe it depends more on the idea and it’s execution, rather than expensive equipment. KGP is full of talented people and I am sure that the event will be a success.</p>

									<p><strong>PROPOSAL-I</strong><br />
1. I propose to conduct social awareness drives on various pressing social issues for the students of IIT Kharagpur, as well as in the villages around the campus. It will have a dual benefit of making the students aware of the social problems, as well as will help in removing these problems in the villages around the campus. To begin with, the awareness drive will be conducted on<br />
the following social issues:<br />
 Child Labor<br />
 Eve Teasing<br />
 Alcoholism<br />
 Drug and Substance Abuse<br />
Duration of each awareness drive will be 2 days, and will be held on a weekend. Within the campus, the awareness drive will include seminars and interactive sessions with the students. The other day, these organizations will be conducting the awareness drive in the village(s). The awareness drive will include rallies as well as one to one interaction with the people. These organizations will also be willing to help the people alleviate their problems, if required. The organizations will be helped by the student volunteers in the village awareness drives.</p>

<p>Benefits:<br />
 It will make the students of IIT Kharagpur, aware about these pressing social issues.<br />
 The awareness created amongst students will help make the campus immune to these social problems.<br />
 This will help in removing these problems from the villages around the campus, thus help in the betterment of the lives of the residents of these villages.<br />
 The activities will involve the students of IIT Kharagpur, and will be covered by media bodies. Thus, it will surely provide a boost to IIT Kharagpur’s image and prestige.<br />
 Since the youth of the country is its future, it will ensure that the students also help in eradicating these problems from the country.</p>

<p><strong>Proposal-II</strong> <br />
2. I propose to organize a Literary Fest in IIT Kharagpur, in association with Technology Literary Society(TLS), IIT Kharagpur, named</p>

<p>“THE HEMMINGWAY”</p>

<p>Which would aim at fostering a love of literature and writing in the campus. This proposal will help create a strong intellectual tradition, and will instill in the rich culture of IIT Kharagpur, an inseparable flavor of literature.</p>

<p>The fest will have the following events:<br />
 Wordsworth: Four esteemed authors/writers will deliver talk distributed over two days. Authors/Writers will talk about their works, lifestyle, literature, insight and inspire the audience. The event may be followed by a book signing ceremony.<br />
 Wordsmith: It will be a two day event. Genre specific workshops will be organized for the participants, by the some or all of the following personalities- lyricists, authors, poets, screenplay writers on day one. This will be followed by the event next day, where the participants will be writing in their genre of interest. These entries will then be judged by these people.<br />
 Today’s Socrates: Panel discussion over intellectual and philosophical topics concerned with literature {Example: endangered languages}. The panelists will include the guests of Wordsworth and the judges of Wordsmith.<br />
 Poetria: It will be a two round event. In first round, participants will have to compose an original poem, related to the theme. The judges will shortlist the entries for the second round. The shortlisted participants will have to recite the poem on stage, in front of the judges. Judging criteria for this round will include the complete performance of the participant on stage, not just mere recitation.<br />
 Faceoff: A turncoat debate.<br />
 Entrevue: An onstage chat show, featuring one of the eminent guests.<br />
 Inquizitive: Quiz event</p>

<p>Benefits:<br />
 It will help create literary awareness in the campus.<br />
 The students of IIT Kharagpur, as well as the outstation participants will get an opportunity to explore the rich cultural aspects of the literature.<br />
 The students will also get a chance to know about various career avenues in field of professional writing.<br />
 The fest will also provide great encouragement to budding writers because they will get to interact with the experts through workshops and panel discussions.<br />
 It will also help in furthering strengthening the strong intellectual tradition, which IIT Kharagpur is proud of.</p>

<p><strong>Proposal-III</strong> <br />
3. I propose to introduce Photography and Film Making Events in Open IIT. Photography: It will be a theme based photography event, with the theme being given 5 days before the submission deadline. It is an individual event and the participants are supposed to submit their entries to the photography secretary, Technology Students’ Gymkhana, within the submission deadline. The top three entries, as decided by the judge will be screened as part of the Foundation Day Program, at the Netaji Auditorium, IIT Kharagpur.<br />
Short Film Making: It will be a theme based short filmmaking event, with the theme being given 15 days before the submission deadline. The participants are supposed to make an original short film, and submit it to the photography secretary, Technology Students’ Gymkhana, within the submission deadline. The top three entries, as decided by the judge will be screened as part of the<br />
Foundation Day Program, at the Netaji Auditorium, IIT Kharagpur.<br />
Benefits:<br />
 It will cater to the photography and filmmaking enthusiasts in the campus, since there is no event of this type in Open IIT and General Championship.<br />
 If these events are successful, the events can be included in the General Championship, giving photography and film enthusiasts a wider platform to showcase their idea and creativity.<br />
 Technology Filmmaking and Photography Society (TFPS) has done a great job in bringing people with a common interest together, and this event will further help in doing the same.</p>

<p>This would face the same hurdles as Bodhi’s proposal. It would certainly be an enormous task to crosscheck all the data which is to be uploaded. Now that the winners would be publicly viewable, there would be a lot of pressure on Hall Presidents and Society governors to include names of individuals whose contribution has been negligible simply so that their CVs can be bloated. Rampant favouritism may also become prevalent.</p>

<p>Candidate’s defence to cons:</p>

<p>Well, I would like to tell you that I have the database from 2012-2013, with details of all the participants. I don’t think it will add to the burden. It will do a good job towards reducing forgery, that people add in their Curriculum Vitae. There will be an official Gymkhana website which takes care of this.</p>

<p><b>3.) Introduction of a social case study competition to be certified and judged by an NGO.</b></p>

<p>Brief summary:</p>

<p>The case study would be based on a real life problem being faced by an NGO. The NGO would judge the event and the best entry may be implemented by the NGO. The event would be a part of Open-IIT.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>This event would use the problem solving and analytical abilities of IITians as a group to solve real world problems. The social contribution and reputation of the institute would increase.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Introducing a time consuming event in Open IIT could be cumbersome, considering the plethora of events that are conducted in such a short span of time. Additionally, there already exists a case study event in Tech GC. A more practical approach would be simply to adapt the Tech GC case study event or shift it to the Soc-Cult GC and impart a social theme to it.</p>

<p>Candidate’s defence to cons:</p>

<p>The thing is that before introducing events in the General Championship, we introduce it in the Open-IIT and gauge its response. We shall publicize the event, and would really appreciate it if students could contribute socially.</p>

<p>The aim of increasing of increasing freshers’ participation is a noble cause indeed. Also, better information will help increase the transparency of the sub-committee meetings as well.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>The vagueness of this proposal means that its implementation is called into effect. A system as wide reaching as the entire campus goes beyond just facebook updates; and by leaving out the modus operandi of the same, it is entirely at the whims of the candidate.</p>

								<p>To the land of <b>eternal youth</b>, “<b>IIT Kharagpur</b>” let me express my deepest gratitude for the privilege of addressing this <b>amazing crowd</b> out here !! It is my <b>honor</b> to be present here in front of you all !!</p>

<p>"<b>Everyone dreams</b> but <b>one who translates dreams into reality leaves an indelible impression on the sands of time</b>"</p>

<p>Ever since I came to IIT Kharagpur, I have been fired with the idea of dedicating myself to the utmost level to this institute, leaving an impression by contributing something substantial. This thought has fed me with great dreams. And as this happened I understood that by being calm and composed in any circumstance, I am in the right place at the right time, and everything happens at the exactly right moment building self-confidencewithin myself.</p>

<p>The honor of being Vice president, Technology student’s gymkhana acts as a crucial link between we all “the students” and the institute’s administration. I believe the Vice President has to be a motivated leader, a dedicated team member and an efficient organizer. My hard work and faith in my abilities are the two potentials that help me acquire necessary motivation for this post.</p>

<p>During my stay at IIT Kharagpur, apart from various educational and technical activities, I have been involved in various hall activities. I was selected as under secretary maintenance for Vidya Sagar hall of residence for academic session 2010-2011.</p>

<p>I was elected as the secretary aquatics sub committee Technology Student Gymkhana for the academic session 2011-2012 and during this tenure I was the organizing secretary for the 47<sup>th</sup> inter IIT held here at IIT Kharagpur. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Having the will and zeal, I was then elected as the Hall President of Vidya Sagar hall of residence for the academic session 2012-2013, managing the day to day responsibilities within the hall of about 400 boarders. </p>

</li>
<li><p>I’ve also represented my hall as a player and as a captain in 5 different games to name volleyball, basketball, cricket, hockey and athletics. I was also the head of the organizing team of Illuminations during the year 2012-2013. </p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>In spite of my active involvement in all these managerial activities and sports I have maintained a CGPA of 8.74 in my Post-Graduations and CGPA of 9 in my PhD I also secured a six months competitive Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade scholarship from the Government of Canada for the internship program in the University of Saskatchewan.</p>

<p>I was honored to receive competitive scholarship from Department of Biotechnology, Government of India to attend workshop at Purdue University USA. </p>

<p>I’ve made 4 international talks in conferences within United States and Canada; and got 2 research publications in international journals.</p>

<p>I have my first book already published by Lambert publishers, Germany and also got one patent registered with my name.</p>

<p>During my Under Graduation I underwent two fully funded internships, one in Government of India farm machinery sector, Government of India and second at IIT Guwahati. </p>

<p>It makes me happy to remember the day I was awarded the best student award in my college.</p>

<p>During my Under-Graduation I was the captain of volleyball and basketball team and I was also the secretary for National games held at Jawaharlal Nehru Krishi Vidya Vidyalaya Jabalpur in the year of 2009 where I successfully initiated to raise funds towards sports activities and games by 30 %.</p>

<p>I have passed a National Cadet Corp C certificate from the student wing of Indian Army with the rank of Under Officer. </p>

<p>I am the founding member of National NGO JEEVAN KAUSHAL working for the social cause of development of 2000 orphans students and a tree plantation program. </p>

<p>I believe that “<b>Coming together</b> is a beginning, <b>keeping together</b> is progress and <b>working together</b> is success!”</p>

<p>With these words I look forward for working together with you all as the Vice president, technology students gymkhana, confidently fulfilling all my respective duties for this post with all your support, love and zeal to do something different and special for our very own eternal land “Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur”.</p>

								<p>A vice president is a crucial link between the student community and the administration of the institute. He is a representative voice of the students and must work tirelessly to uphold their best interests. Therefore, the vice president must be a dedicated worker and a motivating leader.</p>

<p>My candidature rests on my strong involvement in diverse activities at IIT Kharagpur, and my consistent record of serving the interests of the students and the Institute.</p>

<p>I represented IIT Kharagpur at the 48th and the 49th Inter IIT Sports meets as a member of the cricket team. In the last edition, we bagged the silver medal in cricket reaching the finals after a gap of 8 years. This contribution helped our institute place third in the inter IIT – General championship.</p>

<p>Within the institute, I have held several positions of responsibility, and have diligently contributed through various roles. I was elected as the secretary, cricket sub-committee, Technology Students’ Gymkhana for the session 2012-2013. During my tenure, IIT Kharagpur witnessed its first ever OPEN IIT cricket tournament being organized. I successfully oversaw the installation of a new lightning system and the procurement of a new roller, grass cutting machine and a sight screen having a net worth of Rs. 16.41 lakhs. I was the only student responsible to organize an Inter university cricket tournament in which 8 teams from all over the state participated. I served as the core organizing team member of Shaurya’12 and solely conducted its cricket event. I was also a part of the silver winning cricket team of IIT Kharagpur in Shaurya’12. Currently, I hold the post of General secretary – sports, Patel hall of residence wherein I coordinated between 17 captains and 6 secretaries to ensure the smooth participation of Patel hall in the sports general championship.</p>

<p>I had been a part of the gold winning open IIT cricket team, silver winning inter hall cricket team and bronze winning inter hall football team of MMM hall of residence. Also I am a part of Patel hall’s cricket, choreography and product design teams.</p>

<p>Moreover, I represented India in a cultural exchange Program at Santa lingua, Russia which witnessed participation from seven other countries. I have also interned at Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories and Hetero Drugs Ltd. To my credit, I have been selected for a summer research project at the National Polytechnic Institute of Toulouse, France.</p>

<p>If selected as the Vice President, I strongly believe that my skills as a leader and team-player can help me cater to the diverse aspirations of the students and contribute to the institute to encourage for cultural diversity.</p>

								<p>The vice president of the Technology Students’ Gymkhana is the representative of the students of IIT Kharagpur in any activity where students’ interests are involved. Voicing their concerns and grievances, the Vice President is the most crucial link between the student community and the institute administration. <br />
During my course of stay at IIT Kharagpur, I have been involved in various extra curricular activities, successfully demonstrating my leadership ability and commitment in each of them. <br />
I have been associated with Kshitij, the annual- techno management fest of IIT Kharagpur for the past two years. <br />
In my second year, I was a core team member at Kshitij 2013 wherein I worked extensively towards the major facets of the fest namely sponsorship, publicity and events.<br />
I was a part of the team which raised a total alumni contribution of Rs 5.79 lacs and published a total of 22 media articles from the regions of Maharashtra, Bihar and West Bengal.<br />
I had also written the official press note of Kshitij 2013 which was published in over 35 national dailies including the likes of The Times Of India, Hindustan Times and The Hindu.<br />
In my 3rd year, I was a Finance Head of Kshitij 2014 wherein I managed a budget of Rs 1.02 crores. In addition to this, I was also responsible for organizing the Workshops and Guest Lectures at Kshitij 2014. I was responsible for organizing the talks by Mr. Nawaazuddin Siddiqui, Ms. Shazia Ilmi, Mr Jonathan Forman (science policy adivisor at the Nobel peace Prize winning Organization OPCW) and Mr. Rajiv Malhotra. I also led a team of 23 members to successfully obtain sponsorship and alumni contribution worth Rs 17.6 lac. I organized the workshops by Mozilla, International Finance Corporation of the World Bank Group and an investigative Journalism workshop by Mr. Shishir Joshi, ex-group chief editor Mid-day. I conceptualized a documentary making contest on eye donation in association with the NGO Drishti, as a social inititative of Kshitij 2014.<br />
For the second consecutive year, I was able to secure the patronage of UNESCO for Kshitij. The ATLAS Virtual Visit by CERN, which happened in any of the IITs for the very first time was my undertaking.<br />
In addition to this I have also actively participated in a number of events conducted by the Gymkhana. In my first year I was a part of the silver winning Open IIT Dumb Charades team and the Gold winning Inter Hall Hindi Dramatics team. In my second year, I was a part of the Gold Winning Open IIT Dumb Charades team and silver winning Inter Hall English Dramatics.<br />
Also in my second year, I was a part of the bronze winning Rangoli team of Azad hall and in my third year I was a part of the team which conceptualized the Gold winning Rangoli.<br />
In the past, I’ve also been a founding member of StIITch- the Inter IIT newsletter.<br />
My involvement in these activities have given me invaluable experience, and I am confident that if elected to the post of Vice President, Technology Students’ Gymkhana, I will be able to utilize this experience and work for the betterment of the student community.</p>

<li>Form a team of 4th-year Dual Degree / MSc students and 1st year PG students under SRIC. Will be repsonsible for approaching companies willing to collaborate with the Institute to work on any ongoing R&amp;D projects.</li>
<li>Appoint Departmental Representatives who will be nominated by the respective HODs.</li>
<li>Create an online portal enabling students to apply for sponsored research projects across various departments, promoting inter-disciplinary research.</li>
<li>Inviting companies to establish Centers of Excellence in respective departments, to bring industrial exposure to students and increase output of corporate firms from the student community.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Proposal 3</strong></p>
<p>I propose to reduce the wastage of mess food by introducing an online mess system for all the Halls of Residence. The students would only have to pay for the meals that they have in the mess.<br>
I also propose to have a centralized mess system for all the Inter-IIT probables so that they can have longer practice sessions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Proposal 4</strong></p>
<p>I propose to introduce a Greivance Cell to cater to the complaints of the students of IIT Kharagpur.</p>
